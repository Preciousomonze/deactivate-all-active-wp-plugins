# deactivate-all-active-wp-plugins
This file just helps easily deactivate all your active plugins on your wordpress site. that's all, it's pretty straight forward 💆🏽‍♂💅🏼
### All you need to do 🤓
- Make sure you copy or download the zip file "wp-pk-deactivate-all-plugins.zip" and put it in your home directory, i.e same directory where wp-config.php file is. You can either extract on your local computer, then upload the file extracted, or upload the zip file to your web host then extract it there . (The zip file only contains the "wp-pk-deactivate-all-plugins.php" file).
- Then run the file in your browser e.g. http://mywpsite.com/wp-pk-deactivate-all-plugins.php assuming the file is in the main directory of the wordpress site, i.e same location where wp-config.php is.
- Don't tell me you tried clicking the example link above, if you did, smh 😪

### You might ask(maybe this is an FAQ) "what's the use? 🙄
##### There could be situations such as the ones listed below.
 - In case your site has a malicious plugin and you don't have time to be logging in and deactivating plugins(especially if there a a lot of sites)
 - In case there's a WSOD(White screen of death 😱), and you dont have the time to be renaming every plugin folder, reloading the site, then renaming back just to deactivate the plugin. Now imagine you have a lot of plugins, how will that be? 🤣
 - In case you don't have the time and stress to go to the database directly, or even the technical skills, so you don't mess up the db and start asking for help(I can help though, but doing it free for you will depend on my mood 🙄).
 - You could easily run the file in any browser and it does it's work.

The list goes on and on 🐒
 
 #### Make sure you delete this file after you're done with it, cause if someone or you, runs it on the browser, it'll deactivate all plugins, don't say i didn't warn you 🙂😂😂
